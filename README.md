# Handwritten Digit Recognition using Deep Learning 🧠✍️

## 📚 Project Description

This project demonstrates a deep learning model that can recognize handwritten digits (0–9) using a neural network trained on the **MNIST** dataset. The system takes an image of a handwritten digit as input and predicts the correct digit in real time. It can also accept user-drawn input on a white canvas.

This project is an example of how deep learning can be applied to practical computer vision tasks such as digit recognition in forms, postal codes, etc.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **OpenCV** (optional for camera-based input)
- **Tkinter** or **Pygame** (for GUI input, if applicable)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
